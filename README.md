# Gospel Glueins
Small quotes to insert into your scriptures.

## How to Use Them
1.	Cut them out along the dotted line
2.	Find the scripture at the top of the Glue-In
3.	Using a glue stick, place glue on the edge of the Glue-In with the margin. This can easily be done by sliding the edge across the glue stick.
4.	Place the glued edge between the pages of your scriptures. It is recommended you try to put them near the bottom of the page so they donâ€™t get in the way of as much text.
5.	Close your scriptures and press on the binding firmly, until the glue has dried.

Some might have some additional instructions/recommendations next to them. It is recommended you follow those instructions.

## What to Print
Print the file [printout.pdf. It can be downloaded here](https://github.com/JoshMayberry/Gospel_Glueins/blob/master/printout.pdf).
It includes all of the glueins, tables, and pictures.

It is recommended you do not print from the source files, such as source.docx, because things might line up differently on your computer than they do on mine, and they might not print out right.

## Can I Modify Them and/or Add my Own
Of course you can.
If you want those changes applied to the source file though, you will have to [submit a report in the Issues tab](https://github.com/JoshMayberry/Gospel_Glueins/issues/new) to let me know what you want added/modified.
