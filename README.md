# Gospel Glueins
Small quotes to insert into your scriptures.

How to Use Them
1.	Cut them out along the dotted line
2.	Find the scripture at the top of the Glue-In
3.	Using a glue stick, place glue on the edge of the Glue-In with the margin. This can easily be done by sliding the edge across the glue stick.
4.	Place the glued edge between the pages of your scriptures. It is recommended you try to put them near the bottom of the page so they donâ€™t get in the way of as much text.
5.	Close your scriptures and press on the binding firmly, until the glue has dried.
